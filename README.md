# CppGameEngine3D

My first attempt at writing a from-scratch OpenGL game engine in C++

## Demo Video

A demonstration of the latest capabilities of the engine and the editor:

## Overview

After transitioning from a Windows to a Macbook, I aborted this C++ version of my game engine for a revamped Java version (see https://github.com/BGR360/JavaGameEngine3D). However, I then discovered that that was a silly decision and have stopped working on the Java version. I have not put any work into this engine for a while and will probably restart from scratch if I want to continue working on it.

## Acknowledgements

I owe many thanks to Jamie King and Benny Bobaganoosh for their great tutorials and learning resources on C++, OpenGL, and Game Engine programming. These guys do great work and you should check them out.
