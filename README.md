# CppGameEngine3D

My first (aborted) attempt at writing a from-scratch OpenGL game engine in C++

A demonstration of the latest capabilities of the engine and the editor:

After transitioning from a Windows to a Macbook, I aborted this C++ version of my game engine for a revamped Java version (see https://github.com/BGR360/JavaGameEngine3D). Many of the design schemes I used in this one will be identical in the new one, so I am keeping this repository up as a reference for myself.
