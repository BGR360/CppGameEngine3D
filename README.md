# CppGameEngine3D

My first attempt at writing a from-scratch OpenGL game engine in C++, humbly called the "Bengine." The [Qt GUI Framework](http://www.qt.io/) is used extensively to provide OpenGL Widgets and make up the GUI for the Bengine Editor (learn more about the Bengine Editor [here]()). The entire engine was programmed using Test-Driven Development strategies, utilizing the [Google Test Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) to swiftly implement unit tests (learn more about the Bengine Tests [here]()).

## Overview

After transitioning from a Windows to a Macbook, I aborted this C++ version of my game engine for a revamped Java version (see https://github.com/BGR360/JavaGameEngine3D). However, I then discovered that that was a silly decision and have stopped working on the Java version. I have not put any work into this engine for a while and will probably restart from scratch if I want to continue working on it.

## Why do I do this?
When I tell people about this project, I often hear them say, "You know, you could always just download Unity or UDK and use that to make games... Why you gotta go and write your own?" So really, why the hell am I doing this?

I'm not making a game engine so that I can make games. Sure, once it's done, I'll be able to do that if I want, but that's not what it's about. It's about the learning experience and the sense of accomplishment that comes with being able to write something from scratch. Sure, it'll never ever be the most efficient or groundbreaking or innovative game engine, but it'll be mine. I think that's pretty damn cool.
