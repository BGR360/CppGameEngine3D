# CppGameEngine3D

My first attempt at writing a from-scratch OpenGL game engine in C++

## Demo Video

## Overview

After transitioning from a Windows to a Macbook, I aborted this C++ version of my game engine for a revamped Java version (see https://github.com/BGR360/JavaGameEngine3D). However, I then discovered that that was a silly decision and have stopped working on the Java version. I have not put any work into this engine for a while and will probably restart from scratch if I want to continue working on it.

## Why do I do this?
When I tell people about this project, I often hear them say, "You know, you could always just download Unity or UDK and use that to make games... Why you gotta go and write your own?" So really, why the hell am I doing this?

I'm not making a game engine so that I can make games. Sure, once it's done, I'll be able to do that if I want, but that's not what it's about. It's about the learning experience and the sense of accomplishment that comes with being able to write something from scratch. Sure, it'll never ever be the most efficient or groundbreaking or innovative game engine, but it'll be mine. I think that's pretty damn cool.

I owe many thanks to Jamie King and Benny Bobaganoosh for their great tutorials and learning resources on C++, OpenGL, and Game Engine programming. These guys do great work and you should check them out.
